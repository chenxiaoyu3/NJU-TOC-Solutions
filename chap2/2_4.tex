\problem{Construct $\AM$ for $g(x) = \mu y. [f(x, y)]$ assuming that $\mathbf{F}\in\AM$
defines $f$.}
\begin{pf} \rm
 Assume that $\mathbf{F}$ uses at most $k$ pillars.
 If $x, y$ is located at position $k + 1, k + 2$, respectively,
 we can compute $f(x, y)$ by
\[
 \mathbf{M} = \cp_{k+1, 1} \cp_{k + 2, 2} \mathbf{F}.
\]

Therefore, $g$ can be constructed by repeatedly enumerate $y$ until $f$ becomes zero:

$g = \mv_{1, k + 1} \mathbf{M} \L \A_{k+2} \cp_{k+1, 1}\cp_{k+2, 2} \mathbf{M} \R_1
\mv_{k + 2, 1} \Z_{k+1}
$.
 \qed
