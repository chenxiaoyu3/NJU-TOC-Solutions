\problem{If $f,g:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ differs for only finitely many
values. Prove that $f\in\GRF$ if and only if $g\in\GRF$. }

\begin{pf} \rm
 For the necessity, we have $g\in\GRF$ and
 $S=\{s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_k\}$ satisfies that
 for all $x\in\mathbb{N}\mathop{\backslash} S$, $f(x) = g(x)$.
 
 Let $\displaystyle F(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} g(s_i)\cdot N(\eq(s_i, x))
 + N\left( \sum_{i=0}^{k} N\Big(\eq(s_i, x)\Big) \right) g(x)$,
 because the $\Sigma$ in $F$ is walked through finitely many of values,
 $F$ is in $\GRF$, and $f(x)=F(x)$ for all $x$, thus $f\in\GRF$.
 Also, the sufficiency case is trivial by symmetry. \qed
