\problem{Let $f(n) = n^{n^{\ldots^n}}$, prove that $f\in \PRF-\EF$.}

\begin{pf} \rm
 Let $g(n, 0) = 0$ and 
 $g(n, x + 1) = n^{ g(n, x)}$. Thus $g\in \PRF$ and $g(n, n) = f(n)$,
 therefore $f\in\PRF$. On the other hand, $G(k, x) = 2^{2^{\ldots^x}}$ is
 one among the control functions of $\EF$. If $f\in EF$, there exists
 $k$ such that $G(k, n) > f(n)$ for all $n$. However, this is impossible
 because $f(k + 2)$ is always greater than $G(k, k+2)$. \qed
