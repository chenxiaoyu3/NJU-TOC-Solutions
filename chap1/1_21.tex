\problem{Let $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ and being 1-1 and onto. Prove that
$f\in\GRF$ if and only if $f^{-1}\in\GRF$.}

\begin{pf} \rm
 The sufficiency can be shown by the fact that 
\[
 f^{-1}(x) = \mu y. |f(y) - x|
\]

\noindent because there exists unique $y$ such that $f(y) = x$,
and hence the root of $|f(y) - x|$. Therefore, $\mu y. |f(y) - x|$ is the unique
value of $y$ satisfying $f(y) = x$, i.e., $y=f^{-1}(x)$.
Also because $\left(f^{-1}\right)^{-1}=f$, the case of necessity is trivial by symmetry. \qed
\end{pf}
