This is the solutions to the book "Introduction to Models of Computation" by Fangmin Song (internal version). We are intended to track the changes of the book, and have a full solution list of all problems.

If you are intended to improve our solutions, you could either fork a repository and notify me to pull your fork, or just post an issue. Posting an "issue" is recommanded - this is easiest and fastest. Improvments ranging from misspellings to illegal proofs are all welcome.

You may "watch" this project to see its current progress.
