\problem{Prove the \emph{Parenthesis Lemma}: for all $M\in\Lambda$, the occurrence
of left parenthesis is equal to the occurrence of right parenthesis.}
\begin{pf} \rm
  Let $p(M)$ be the difference of the occurrence of left and right parenthesis in $M$,
  We have $p(x) = 0$, $p[(M_1M_2)] = p(M_1) + p(M_2)$ and
  $p[ (\lambda x.M) ] = p(M)$. A formal proof comes from a simple structural induction. \qed
