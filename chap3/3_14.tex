\problem{Prove that for binary relation $R$ on $\Lambda$, $M\in NF_R$ implies:
(1) there is no $N\in\Lambda$ such that $M\to_R N$; (2) $M\twoheadrightarrow_R N
\Rightarrow M\equiv N$.}
\begin{pf} \rm
(1) Trivial by the definition of $\NF_R$ that, $M$ has no redex.

\noindent (2) Assume that $M\not\equiv N$. $M\twoheadrightarrow_R N$ implies
existence of $M=P_0,\ldots,P_n=N$ that, $P_i\to_R P_{i+1}$ for $i<n$.
We must have $n\geq 1$ because $M\not\equiv N$. This leads to contradiction
because there exists $N$ such that $M\to_R N$. \qed
