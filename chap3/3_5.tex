\problem{Prove the fixed-point theorem for two variables: for all $F,G\in\Lambda$, exists
$X,Y\in\Lambda$ such that $FXY=X$ and $GXY=Y$. }
\begin{pf} \rm
 According to the equation $(GX)Y=Y$, let $Y$ be the fixed-point of $GX$, say $\Y(GX)$,
 we have $FX(\Y(GX))=X$, thus
  \[\lambda x.[Fx (\Y(Gx)) ] X = X.\]
 We can now derive a solution by letting $X=\Y [\lambda x.Fx (\Y(Gx)) ]$ and $Y=\Y(GX)$.
