\problem{Let $\D\equiv \lambda xyz.z(\K y)x$. Prove that for all $X,Y\in\Lambda$,
$\D XY\churchnumber{0} = X$ and $\D XY\churchnumber{n+1} = Y$. }
\begin{pf} \rm
 We have $\D XY\churchnumber{0} = 
  \churchnumber{0} (\lambda y. Y) X
  = (\lambda fx. x) (\lambda y.Y) X = X
 $, and
 \[
\begin{array}{rcl}
 \D XY\churchnumber{n+1} & = &
  \churchnumber{n+1} (\lambda y. Y) X \\
  &=& (\lambda fx. f^{n+1} x)(\lambda y.Y) X \\
  &=& (\lambda x. (\lambda y.Y)^{n+1} x) X \\ 
  &=& (\lambda x. (\lambda y.Y)^n Y)X \\
  &=& (\lambda x. Y)X = Y.\\
\end{array}
  \]

\noindent $\D$ is very powerful because it have the ability of separating cases.
