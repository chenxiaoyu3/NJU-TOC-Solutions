\problem{Prove that there exists $B\in\Lambdaclosed$ such that
$F_{[\churchnumber{x}\mapsto x]} \equivbeta BFx\churchnumber{x}$.}
\begin{pf} \rm
 We first construct the minimum representation of a $\lambda$ term to identify the
 $\equiv$ relationship of $\Lambdaclosed$ such that
\[
 \mathbf{min} X =\mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}_{M\in\Lambdaclosed, M\equiv X} \churchnumber{M}.
\]

 We can compute $\mathbf{min}$ by a recursive procedure that keeps a table of variable substitution,
 and log the minimum unused number in each abstraction operation (very complicated, though).
 Since every function in $\PRF$ can be represented in $\lambda$-calculus,
 $\mathbf{min}\in\Lambdaclosed$ exists.
 Also, we have $\mathbf{minus}\in\Lambdaclosed$ such that 
 $\mathbf{minus}\churchnumber{x}\churchnumber{y} = 
 \churchnumber{|x-y|}$. Therefore, let
\[
 B = \lambda fxyz. \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{minus} (\mathbf{min}y) (\mathbf{min}z))x(fz),
\]
$F_{[\churchnumber{x}\mapsto x]} \equivbeta BFx\churchnumber{x}$
is achieved. 
\qed
